# Gastrointestinal Polyp Segmentation

*What is Polyp and why segmentation is needed?*
- Gastrointestinal polyps are growths of tissue in the inner lining of the stomach. They are usually found incidentally during an upper endoscopy. While they are generally benign, they can potentially develop into cancer.
- Research in this field has the potential to help reduce the polyp miss rate and thus improve examination quality.
